This tool requires node to be installed on your computer.  It also requires the inquirer package.  Inquirer 8.2.4 is the recommended version.

To use this tool, simply open a terminal window and type “node index” then answer the prompts.  When finished, there is a notification that “Your README has been generated” and the file is located inside the Develop folder with the title README.md.

## Credits
The students in the Bootcamp class, particularly during the small groups and study groups, were very helpful in debugging the initial code and making it functional.
